I have been having problems with my interactive RStudio sessions on bianca since last Friday. The RStudio interface is quite sluggish and gets stuck either just loading or in doing a simple task like loading an R package (for example limma). I wonder if there is something that has gone awry with my project or what has changed to cause this. I encounter this even when bianca is not particularly busy. I have tried shutting down my virtual session and logging in again several times, as well as restarting my browser, and still encounter a sluggish session. Below are the commands I use:

```
## start an interactive session with a whole node ( I also tried variations of this with a few cores)
interactive -A sens2023036 -p node -t 2-10

## load R_packages module
module load R_packages/4.3.1

## load RStudio module
module load RStudio/2023.12.1-402

## start RStudio
rstudio
```


The attached screenshots show the unchanged state of the session after several hours. I also noticed “core” files appearing in my home path. I am attaching a screenshot of those as well. Could there be an issue with my project specifically or what do you think could be explaining the lag? Many thanks in advance for your help!

Try allocating at lease 2 cores fore the interactive session.
You may also try the next-latest RStudio version, just before 2023.12., i.e. RStudio/2023.06.2-561.

## Mon Nov 18 16:39:17

Thanks for your quick reply. I have been allocating several cores with this. However, using a different RStudio module seems to have worked. Many thanks!


## Mon Nov 18 19:59:54 2024

Good it works!

Sorry I missed that you tried a whole node.

Which version of RStudio do you get when you just load it without version set?

From your images it looks like you are still running on bianca login node.

Are you sure you are starting RStudio from the terminal screen where the interactive sessions starts? You should have a "b<number>" address, not a "bianca" address.

I am attaching the images here which show the issue from the interactive session (10 nodes) which I currently have running, called “sens2023036-b10”. Thanks!

Hi Björn,

Thanks for checking this. Indeed, I was using specific versions (R_packages/4.3.1
and RStudio/2023.12.1-402) for reproducibility reasons. With RStudio it
matters less so, so that’s ok. However today I am running into the same
problems again, and even got an email that I am running out of memory when
RStudio is simply trying to launch. I see RStudio open up but stuck (as in
the screenshots I originally shared). This is with 10 nodes in my
interactive session, so it’s a bit odd.

I wonder if I broke something last week, when I had to ctrl+c in the
terminal running RStudio to exit, since it was stuck and wouldn’t close.

Which is Friday 15th November 2024, which is way after
the [maintenance on November 3rd](https://status.uppmax.uu.se/2024-11-03/november-maintenance/)
and before
[a next system status message (regarding Rackham) on 22nd November](https://status.uppmax.uu.se/2024-11-22/rackham-failed-jobs/)

I can see RStudio, but in the console it is lagging and I cannot type (keeps trying to load on the bottom right panel). This is even though I reserve an entire node for my interactive session and use the default R_packages and RStudio modules.

## Meeting notes 2024-12-06 14:00

- User cannot demonstrate, due to a reported Bianca slowness that needs fixing
- Either meet Tuesday 17 Dec afternoon, or ask another colleague to take over
    - Decision: meet Tuesday 17 Dec 14:00

From user:

`module load rstudio` works fine,
but `module load R_packages` and `module load rstudio`
gives a problem. Those packages are needed!
